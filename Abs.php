<p class="WorkoutInfo">Abs may not be the most challenging body part to train, but visible results can remain elusive. That's because, when all's said and done, a great workout can be undone by poor eating habits and body-fat levels more suited to a hibernating bear in winter.</p>	

<br>

<p class="WorkoutInfo">Prioritizing your midsection requires not just a great workout but a commitment to eating clean and doing cardio to help get you lean. While the latter is beyond the scope of this article, we can show you the elements of how to manipulate exercises, rest periods, volume, resistance, and training frequency so that you do the right routine based on your goals and experience.</p>	

<br>

<p class="WorkoutInfo">Low body fat may help your waistline appear lean, but that doesn't mean your abs have the peaks and valleys to make your midsection pop. 
Here's a routine that uses added resistance beyond your body weight to signal muscle growth, helping transform a merely flat or underdeveloped washboard into a three-dimensional, topographical six-pack. The workout is also balanced between the three key areas of the midsection—the upper abs, lower abs, and the obliques—to ensure top-to-bottom, side-to-side development.</p>	


<br>
<br>
<br>

<p class="WorkoutInfo">To thicken up the bricks of the rectus abdominis (six-pack), you'll choose a resistance so that you reach muscle failure at a fairly low rep target, about 8-12. This relatively heavier weight is superior for building muscle compared to high-rep bodyweight exercises. Similarly, if you want to build thicker obliques, continue to use a fairly low rep target. 
Many lifters aren't looking to build a blockier midsection, so they instead choose slightly lighter weights on oblique movements.</p>	

<br>

<p class="WorkoutInfo">Moderate-rep exercises are combined with higher-rep moves to ensure that all the fibers are worked completely. Start with the most difficult exercises and progress to easier ones as your midsection fatigues. Most people find that lower-ab exercises are slightly more difficult, so start there.
Though the rectus abdominis is a single muscle, you can put more emphasis on the lower region by securing your upper body and bringing your hips and pelvis toward your ribcage. Conversely, keeping your lower body anchored and curling your upper torso toward your hips works the upper abs more strongly.</p>
