<p class="WorkoutInfo">When you crack your exercise toolkit open each week on back day, you've got a seemingly endless array of movements available. Knowing which tools are best suited for building a wide, thick back will help you get the job done faster, 
which is why we've assembled our list of top 10 mass-building back exercises.</p>	

<br>

<p class="WorkoutInfo">If you get bowled over by the sheer number of rows you can do on back day, or even draw a total blank when thinking of new exercises to try, consider this list your new back blueprint. Give us your thoughts at the bottom in the comments and add any other recommendations you might have!</p>	

<br>

<p class="WorkoutInfo">Barbell Deadlift: This is technically more than a back exercise—it hits the entire posterior chain from your calves to your upper traps—but it's the absolute best for overall backside development. 
Technique is uber-important with the deadlift, but once you nail it, you can progress to lifting monster weights that will recruit maximum muscle, 
release muscle-building hormones, and help you get big.</p>	

<br>


<p class="WorkoutInfo">There are also numerous deadlift progression programs you can follow to help you reach new personal bests. Physiologists love to prescribe the 
deadlift when programming for strength and conditioning because the exercise hammers your musculature and is one of the best choices to strengthen your bone structure.</p>	

<br>

<p class="WorkoutInfo">n your workout: If you're going heavy (sets of fewer than about 6 reps), do deadlifts first so you're fresh. If you're doing deads for repetitions, you can do them later in your workout.</p>	

<p class="WorkoutInfo">Bent-Over Barbell Deadlift: This is probably the second-best back movement in terms of sheer weight you can lift. EMG research has suggested that hitting bent-over barbell rows will work the larger muscle groups of the upper and 
lower back equally, making this a great overall back builder.[2] Like the deadlift, this is another technical move that requires excellent form but rewards you with a ton of muscle.</p>	

<br>

<p class="WorkoutInfo">In your workout: Do bent-over rows toward the start of your back workout for heavy sets in lower rep ranges, about 6-8 or 8-10. The Smith version is a suitable substitute; it locks you in the vertical plane, but your body has to be in just the right position relative to the bar.</p>
